- See which agents were invoked
- Check log counts per agent
- Download logs for offline analysis

#### Help Tab
- Quick reference for supported queries
- Example requests for each agent type
- Tips for effective usage

### Trade Confirmation Workflow

1. **Request a trade** through the chat interface
2. **Review the analysis** provided by the system
3. **Confirm details** in the trade confirmation form:
   - Symbol
   - Action (buy/sell)
   - Quantity
   - Price (optional)
4. **Submit** to execute the trade
5. **View results** in the response area

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Failed to discover Portfolio Manager API ID"
- Ensure your AWS infrastructure is deployed
- Check AWS credentials and permissions
- Verify the APP_NAME and ENV_NAME match your deployment
- Set PORTFOLIO_MANAGER_API_ID manually in .env

#### "No logs found for this execution"
- Wait a few seconds after execution completes
- Ensure CloudWatch Logs permissions are configured
- Check if the Lambda functions are creating logs

#### Streamlit Threading Warnings
- These are suppressed by default but are harmless
- Related to background thread usage for async operations

#### Poetry Installation Issues
- Ensure Python 3.12+ is installed
- Try `poetry update` if dependencies conflict
- Use pip installation as an alternative

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see raw API responses:
1. Check "Show Debug Info" in the sidebar
2. Raw JSON responses will appear below formatted results

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Enable auto-reload
streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.runOnSave true

# Custom port
streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 8080

# Enable debug logging
STREAMLIT_LOG_LEVEL=debug streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Project Structure

```
streamlit_app.py          # Main application file
requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
pyproject.toml           # Poetry configuration
.env                     # Environment configuration (not in git)
