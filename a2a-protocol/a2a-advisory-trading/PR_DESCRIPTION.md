## Summary

This PR improves the deployment and setup experience for the A2A Advisory Trading solution by:

- **Enhanced copy/paste experience**: Converted deployment tables to code blocks for easier command copying
- **Virtual environment support**: Added Python virtual environment setup to avoid dependency conflicts
- **API ID extraction**: Added commands to extract Portfolio Manager API ID from Terraform state
- **CLI improvements**: Added support for passing API ID via command line argument or environment variable

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Updates (`docs/main/solution_deployment.md`)
- Converted deployment command tables to code blocks for better copy/paste experience
- Added virtual environment setup instructions
- Added commands to extract API ID from Terraform state without changing directories
- Documented multiple ways to run the CLI (env var, argument, interactive)

### 2. Makefile Fix
- Changed `pip` to `python3 -m pip` for universal compatibility across platforms

### 3. CLI Enhancement (`cli.py`)
- Added support for `PORTFOLIO_MANAGER_API_ID` environment variable
- CLI now accepts API ID as first command line argument
- Priority order: CLI arg > env var > interactive prompt

## Testing

```bash
# Set up virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pyfiglet colorama halo aiohttp boto3

# Deploy infrastructure
make deploy-core
make deploy-market-analysis
make deploy-risk-assessment
make deploy-trade-execution
make deploy-portfolio-manager

# Extract and set API ID
export PORTFOLIO_MANAGER_API_ID=$(grep -o "https://[^\"]*execute-api[^\"]*" iac/agents/portfolio_manager/terraform.tfstate | head -1 | cut -d'/' -f3 | cut -d'.' -f1)

# Run CLI (now works without prompting for API ID)
python cli.py
```

## Benefits

- **Improved developer experience**: Easier to follow deployment steps with copy-ready commands
- **Reduced errors**: Virtual environment prevents dependency conflicts
- **Faster setup**: API ID can be automatically extracted and reused
- **Flexible usage**: Multiple ways to provide API ID to the CLI
